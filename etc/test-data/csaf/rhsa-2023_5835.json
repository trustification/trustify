A client can repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream and immediately send an RST_STREAM frame to cancel it. This creates extra work for the server setting up and tearing down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection, resulting in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. Red Hat has rated the severity of this flaw as 'Important' as the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) declared this vulnerability an active exploit.\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-39325 was assigned for the Rapid Reset Attack in the Go language packages.\r\n\r\nSecurity Bulletin\r\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/RHSB-2023-003",
