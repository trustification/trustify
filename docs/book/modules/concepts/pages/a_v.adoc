= Advisories & vulnerabilities

Trustify learns about xref:index.adoc#vulnerability[Vulnerabilities] by ingesting advisories. During the ingestion
process, Trustify extracts and aggregates vulnerability information, grouped by their vulnerability identifier.

Advisories can contain multiple vulnerabilities and can scope the application of statements the advisories make to
certain packages. This means that Trustify has an aggregated set of information for a vulnerability, where information
from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project supersedes information from more specific advisories.

Trustify also has "vulnerabilities belonging to an advisory", which contain specific vulnerability information,
provided by that advisory.
