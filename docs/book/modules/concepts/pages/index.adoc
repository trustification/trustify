= Concepts

The following sections explain a few concepts of Trustify.

[#vulnerability]
== Vulnerability

A vulnerability is primarily a *name* for ensuring all advisories are discussing the same thing.
Generally, most vulnerabilities come from the CVE Project, with the format of `CVE-2024-1234`.

Within the database, Trustify adds the vulnerability when discovering an advisory mentioning it.

A *CVE Record* from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD) is a
low-value advisory that is generally the first discovered advisory that mentions a vulnerability.

== Advisory

An advisory is an opinion about a vulnerability.

These opinions include the context to which the opinions apply.
These opinions include evaluation of the severity and scoring of a vulnerability within that context, such as
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores.

As mentioned above, a *CVE Record* from the CVE Project is a low-value advisory that mentions the vulnerability and provides a base opinion about it.
It might include CVSS scores, within the context of the abstract origin containing the vulnerability.
This might be simply in reference to the vulnerability *as it exists in source-code form*.

Other, more-involved stakeholders, such as, product vendors, upstream project owners, might issue *additional*
advisories.
These opinions might be in reference to *concrete*, shipped products, contextualized to how the vulnerable code is *actually used*.

== SBOM

An SBOM is a source-of-someone's-truth about "what's inside it?", so
everything in our DB is ultimately sourced from some
source-of-truth. We cannot really say definitively "product X is
composed of A1, A2 + A3". Instead, we can have multiple simultaneous
statements -- SBOM's -- from multiple people saying "product X is
claimed by Bob to be A1 + A2" and "product X is claimed by Jim to be
A1 + A97". So an SBOM is the entity to track the origin of the
supposed "evidence" of assertional statements about products... about
packages... about vulnerabilities...

== Package

A package is an atomic artifact or component.
Packages can be addressed using pURLs.
A package can be described by an SBOM describing how it is created and its contents.
A package can certainly contain other packages. For example, shading one Java jar into another.
A package can also be the sole member of a product. For example `UBI-8.0.13-x86.oci` can be the singular package within the "UBI 8.0.13-x86" product.
A package is one step more abstract than an *artifact*.

=== pURL

Package URLs (pURLs) are possibly ambiguous names applied to packages.
A simple pURL such as `pkg:maven/org.apache/log4j@1.2.3` can or cannot refer to a unique artifact.
With additional qualifiers, it is possible to produce a URI that asserts uniqueness, such as `pkg:maven/org.apache/log4j@1.2.3?repository_url=repo.jboss.com`.
Without additional qualifiers, the implicit aspects, such as `repository_url`, must be taken into account.
For instance, an unqualified `pkg:maven` pURL *implies* "the jar from Maven Central, and none other".

== Product

A product is a *named collection of 1 or more packages* for a concrete shippable thing.

Products can be addressed using Common Platform Enumerations (CPE) or some other future identification method.
A product can be described by an SBOM describing its components, which might be other products or packages, or their SBOMs.

NOTE: Given Red Hat Product Security definitions, grouping of products might need to occur within some sense of product
versions, or product streams.

`Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8` might be a *product stream*.
`Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2.03 PowerPC` might be a concrete *product* distinct from `Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2.03 AArch64`.

=== CPE

A CPE is a "Common Product Enumeration" from the NIST organization.
CPEs are self-assigned but registered occasionally with NIST.
CPEs describe the vendor, the product, the version, target architecture, etc.
CPEs can also be non-fully specified, to use as pattern-matching.
For instance, "All versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2.013, regardless of platform", or if more fully-specified,
could imply "All versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x on AArch64".

NOTE: CPEs are somewhat contentious, and used enough for us to not ignore, but not used enough to be a pivotal definition of "product" for any users of Trustify.

== Artifact

For a given *package*, there can be zero or more instances of that package.
Given `log4j-1.2.3.jar`, seventeen different people could compile the same source with the same arguments, and still end
up with 17 distinct Java jars, due to non-reproducible builds.
Each is an artifact of the *same* package.
Each might, and most likely will, have its own SHA-256 related to it.

Consider an *artifact* to be a concrete *instance* of a package.
