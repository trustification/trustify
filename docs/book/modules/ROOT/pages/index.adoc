The Trustify project is a collection of software components that enables you to store and retrieve Software Bill of
Materials (SBOMs), and advisory documents. Developers can use this information to
learn about common security vulnerabilities and dependency changes within their software supply chain.

Trustify can do the following:

* Store SBOM and advisory documents for your software and its dependencies.
* Discover and learn the state of vulnerabilities related to your software.
* Explore SBOM and advisory documents by using search queries.
* Share access to your SBOM and Advisory information with others.
