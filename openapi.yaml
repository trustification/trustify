          EBNF grammar for the _q_ parameter:
          ```text
              q = ( values | filter ) { '&' q }
              values = value { '|', values }
              filter = field, operator, values
              operator = "=" | "!=" | "~" | "!~" | ">=" | ">" | "<=" | "<"
              value = (* any text but escape special characters with '\' *)
              field = (* must match an entity attribute name *)
          ```
          Any values in a _q_ will result in a case-insensitive "full
          text search", effectively producing an OR clause of LIKE
          clauses for every string-ish field in the resource being
          queried.

          Examples:
          - `foo` - any field containing 'foo'
          - `foo|bar` - any field containing either 'foo' OR 'bar'
          - `foo&bar` - some field contains 'foo' AND some field contains 'bar'

          A _filter_ may also be used to constrain the results. The
          filter's field name must correspond to one of the resource's
          attributes. If it doesn't, an error will be returned
          containing a list of the valid fields for that resource.

          The value 'null' is treated specially for [Not]Equal filters:
          it returns resources on which the field isn't set. Use the
          LIKE operator, `~`, to match a literal "null" string. Omit the
          value to match an empty string.

          Examples:
          - `name=foo` - entity's _name_ matches 'foo' exactly
          - `name~foo` - entity's _name_ contains 'foo', case-insensitive
          - `name~foo|bar` - entity's _name_ contains either 'foo' OR 'bar', case-insensitive
          - `name=` - entity's _name_ is the empty string, ''
          - `name=null` - entity's _name_ isn't set
          - `published>3 days ago` - date values can be "human time"

          Multiple full text searches and/or filters should be
          '&'-delimited -- they are logically AND'd together.

          - `red hat|fedora&labels:type=cve|osv&published>last wednesday 17:00`

          Fields corresponding to JSON objects in the database may use a
          ':' to delimit the column name and the object key,
          e.g. `purl:qualifiers:type=pom`

          Any operator or special character, e.g. '|', '&', within a
          value should be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.

          The optional _order_ should be one of "asc" or "desc". If

          - `name=foo` - entity's _name_ matches 'foo' exactly
          - `name~foo` - entity's _name_ contains 'foo', case-insensitive
          - `name~foo|bar` - entity's _name_ contains either 'foo' OR 'bar', case-insensitive
          - `name=` - entity's _name_ is the empty string, ''
          - `name=null` - entity's _name_ isn't set
          - `published>3 days ago` - date values can be "human time"

          Multiple full text searches and/or filters should be
          '&'-delimited -- they are logically AND'd together.

          - `red hat|fedora&labels:type=cve|osv&published>last wednesday 17:00`

          Fields corresponding to JSON objects in the database may use a
          ':' to delimit the column name and the object key,
          e.g. `purl:qualifiers:type=pom`

          Any operator or special character, e.g. '|', '&', within a
          value should be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.

              value = (* any text but escape special characters with '\' *)
              field = (* must match an entity attribute name *)
          ```
          Any values in a _q_ will result in a case-insensitive "full
          text search", effectively producing an OR clause of LIKE
          clauses for every string-ish field in the resource being
          queried.

          Examples:
          - `foo` - any field containing 'foo'
          - `foo|bar` - any field containing either 'foo' OR 'bar'
          - `foo&bar` - some field contains 'foo' AND some field contains 'bar'

          A _filter_ may also be used to constrain the results. The
          filter's field name must correspond to one of the resource's
          attributes. If it doesn't, an error will be returned
          containing a list of the valid fields for that resource.

          The value 'null' is treated specially for [Not]Equal filters:
          it returns resources on which the field isn't set. Use the
          LIKE operator, `~`, to match a literal "null" string. Omit the
          value to match an empty string.

          Examples:
          - `name=foo` - entity's _name_ matches 'foo' exactly
          - `name~foo` - entity's _name_ contains 'foo', case-insensitive
          - `name~foo|bar` - entity's _name_ contains either 'foo' OR 'bar', case-insensitive

              value = (* any text but escape special characters with '\' *)
              field = (* must match an entity attribute name *)
          ```
          Any values in a _q_ will result in a case-insensitive "full
          text search", effectively producing an OR clause of LIKE
          clauses for every string-ish field in the resource being
          queried.

          Examples:
          - `foo` - any field containing 'foo'
          - `foo|bar` - any field containing either 'foo' OR 'bar'
          - `foo&bar` - some field contains 'foo' AND some field contains 'bar'

          A _filter_ may also be used to constrain the results. The
          filter's field name must correspond to one of the resource's
          attributes. If it doesn't, an error will be returned
          containing a list of the valid fields for that resource.

          The value 'null' is treated specially for [Not]Equal filters:
          it returns resources on which the field isn't set. Use the
          LIKE operator, `~`, to match a literal "null" string. Omit the
          value to match an empty string.

          Examples:
          - `name=foo` - entity's _name_ matches 'foo' exactly
          - `name~foo` - entity's _name_ contains 'foo', case-insensitive
          - `name~foo|bar` - entity's _name_ contains either 'foo' OR 'bar', case-insensitive
          - `name=` - entity's _name_ is the empty string, ''
          - `name=null` - entity's _name_ isn't set
          - `published>3 days ago` - date values can be "human time"

          Multiple full text searches and/or filters should be
          '&'-delimited -- they are logically AND'd together.

          Fields corresponding to JSON objects in the database may use a
          ':' to delimit the column name and the object key,
          e.g. `purl:qualifiers:type=pom`

          Any operator or special character, e.g. '|', '&', within a
          value should be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.

              value = (* any text but escape special characters with '\' *)
              field = (* must match an entity attribute name *)
          ```
          Any values in a _q_ will result in a case-insensitive "full
          text search", effectively producing an OR clause of LIKE
          clauses for every string-ish field in the resource being
          queried.

          Examples:
          - `foo` - any field containing 'foo'
          - `foo|bar` - any field containing either 'foo' OR 'bar'
          - `foo&bar` - some field contains 'foo' AND some field contains 'bar'

          A _filter_ may also be used to constrain the results. The
          filter's field name must correspond to one of the resource's
          attributes. If it doesn't, an error will be returned
          containing a list of the valid fields for that resource.

          The value 'null' is treated specially for [Not]Equal filters:
          it returns resources on which the field isn't set. Use the
          LIKE operator, `~`, to match a literal "null" string. Omit the
          value to match an empty string.

          Examples:
          - `name=foo` - entity's _name_ matches 'foo' exactly
          - `name~foo` - entity's _name_ contains 'foo', case-insensitive
          - `name~foo|bar` - entity's _name_ contains either 'foo' OR 'bar', case-insensitive
          - `name=` - entity's _name_ is the empty string, ''
          - `name=null` - entity's _name_ isn't set
          - `published>3 days ago` - date values can be "human time"

          Multiple full text searches and/or filters should be
          '&'-delimited -- they are logically AND'd together.

          - `red hat|fedora&labels:type=cve|osv&published>last wednesday 17:00`

          Fields corresponding to JSON objects in the database may use a
          ':' to delimit the column name and the object key,
          e.g. `purl:qualifiers:type=pom`

          Any operator or special character, e.g. '|', '&', within a
          value should be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.

          A _filter_ may also be used to constrain the results. The
          filter's field name must correspond to one of the resource's
          attributes. If it doesn't, an error will be returned
          containing a list of the valid fields for that resource.

          The value 'null' is treated specially for [Not]Equal filters:
          it returns resources on which the field isn't set. Use the
          LIKE operator, `~`, to match a literal "null" string. Omit the
          value to match an empty string.

          Examples:
          - `name=foo` - entity's _name_ matches 'foo' exactly
          - `name~foo` - entity's _name_ contains 'foo', case-insensitive
          - `name~foo|bar` - entity's _name_ contains either 'foo' OR 'bar', case-insensitive
          - `name=` - entity's _name_ is the empty string, ''
          - `name=null` - entity's _name_ isn't set
          - `published>3 days ago` - date values can be "human time"

          Multiple full text searches and/or filters should be
          '&'-delimited -- they are logically AND'd together.

          - `red hat|fedora&labels:type=cve|osv&published>last wednesday 17:00`

          Fields corresponding to JSON objects in the database may use a
          ':' to delimit the column name and the object key,
          e.g. `purl:qualifiers:type=pom`

          Any operator or special character, e.g. '|', '&', within a
          value should be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.

              value = (* any text but escape special characters with '\' *)
              field = (* must match an entity attribute name *)
          ```
          Any values in a _q_ will result in a case-insensitive "full
          text search", effectively producing an OR clause of LIKE
          clauses for every string-ish field in the resource being
          queried.

          Examples:
          - `foo` - any field containing 'foo'
          - `foo|bar` - any field containing either 'foo' OR 'bar'
          - `foo&bar` - some field contains 'foo' AND some field contains 'bar'

          - `name=null` - entity's _name_ isn't set
          - `published>3 days ago` - date values can be "human time"

          Any values in a _q_ will result in a case-insensitive "full
          text search", effectively producing an OR clause of LIKE
          clauses for every string-ish field in the resource being
          queried.

          Examples:
          - `foo` - any field containing 'foo'
          - `foo|bar` - any field containing either 'foo' OR 'bar'
          - `foo&bar` - some field contains 'foo' AND some field contains 'bar'

          A _filter_ may also be used to constrain the results. The
          filter's field name must correspond to one of the resource's
          attributes. If it doesn't, an error will be returned
          containing a list of the valid fields for that resource.

          The value 'null' is treated specially for [Not]Equal filters:
          it returns resources on which the field isn't set. Use the
          LIKE operator, `~`, to match a literal "null" string. Omit the
          value to match an empty string.

          Examples:
          - `name=foo` - entity's _name_ matches 'foo' exactly
          - `name~foo` - entity's _name_ contains 'foo', case-insensitive
          - `name~foo|bar` - entity's _name_ contains either 'foo' OR 'bar', case-insensitive
          - `name=` - entity's _name_ is the empty string, ''
          - `name=null` - entity's _name_ isn't set
          - `published>3 days ago` - date values can be "human time"

          Multiple full text searches and/or filters should be
          '&'-delimited -- they are logically AND'd together.

          EBNF grammar for the _q_ parameter:
          ```text
              q = ( values | filter ) { '&' q }
              values = value { '|', values }
              filter = field, operator, values
              operator = "=" | "!=" | "~" | "!~" | ">=" | ">" | "<=" | "<"
              value = (* any text but escape special characters with '\' *)
              field = (* must match an entity attribute name *)
          ```
          Any values in a _q_ will result in a case-insensitive "full
          text search", effectively producing an OR clause of LIKE
          clauses for every string-ish field in the resource being
          queried.

          Examples:
          - `foo` - any field containing 'foo'
          - `foo|bar` - any field containing either 'foo' OR 'bar'
          - `foo&bar` - some field contains 'foo' AND some field contains 'bar'

          A _filter_ may also be used to constrain the results. The
          filter's field name must correspond to one of the resource's
          attributes. If it doesn't, an error will be returned
          containing a list of the valid fields for that resource.

          The value 'null' is treated specially for [Not]Equal filters:
          it returns resources on which the field isn't set. Use the
          LIKE operator, `~`, to match a literal "null" string. Omit the
          value to match an empty string.

          Examples:
          - `name=foo` - entity's _name_ matches 'foo' exactly
          - `name~foo` - entity's _name_ contains 'foo', case-insensitive
          - `name~foo|bar` - entity's _name_ contains either 'foo' OR 'bar', case-insensitive
          - `name=` - entity's _name_ is the empty string, ''
          - `name=null` - entity's _name_ isn't set
          - `published>3 days ago` - date values can be "human time"

          Multiple full text searches and/or filters should be
          '&'-delimited -- they are logically AND'd together.

          - `red hat|fedora&labels:type=cve|osv&published>last wednesday 17:00`

          Fields corresponding to JSON objects in the database may use a
          ':' to delimit the column name and the object key,
          e.g. `purl:qualifiers:type=pom`

          Any operator or special character, e.g. '|', '&', within a
          value should be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.

              order = ( "asc" | "desc" )
              field = (* must match the name of entity's attributes *)
          ```
          The optional _order_ should be one of "asc" or "desc". If
          omitted, the order defaults to "asc".

          Each _field_ name must correspond to one of the columns of the
          table holding the entities being queried. Those corresponding
          to JSON objects in the database may use a ':' to delimit the
